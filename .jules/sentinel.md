## 2024-05-22 - Hardcoded Secrets in Express Server
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded JWT secret fallback found in `chat-api/server.js`.
**Learning:** Providing insecure default values for security-critical configuration (like JWT secrets) is a common pattern that can lead to production vulnerabilities if environment variables are misconfigured.
**Prevention:** Strictly validate the presence of required security environment variables at application startup and fail fast (exit) if they are missing. Avoid insecure defaults in code.

## 2024-05-22 - Missing Authentication on Sensitive Routes
**Vulnerability:** Multiple sensitive API endpoints (CRM, Loyalty, Tickets) were mounted without any authentication middleware, allowing unauthenticated access to PII and business data.
**Learning:** Middleware application order and scope is critical. Mounting routes with `app.use('/path', routes)` does not automatically apply auth unless globally applied or explicitly included.
**Prevention:** Use a "secure by default" approach. Apply authentication middleware globally or to parent route groups. Explicitly exclude public routes rather than explicitly including protected ones.
**Fix Detail:** The existing `middleware/auth.js` was using a legacy DB-session approach incompatible with the JWTs issued by `server.js`. It was rewritten to correctly verify JWTs.
