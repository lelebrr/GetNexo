## 2024-05-22 - Hardcoded Secrets in Express Server
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded JWT secret fallback found in `chat-api/server.js`.
**Learning:** Providing insecure default values for security-critical configuration (like JWT secrets) is a common pattern that can lead to production vulnerabilities if environment variables are misconfigured.
**Prevention:** Strictly validate the presence of required security environment variables at application startup and fail fast (exit) if they are missing. Avoid insecure defaults in code.
