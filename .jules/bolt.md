## 2025-02-27 - Backend Tests & Native Modules
**Learning:** `chat-api` tests fail because `better-sqlite3` native bindings are missing and cannot be rebuilt in the current environment due to restricted permissions or missing build tools, despite `pnpm install` success.
**Action:** Rely on static analysis for backend DB changes or mock the DB layer if possible.

## 2025-02-27 - Frontend Testing & CSP
**Learning:** The application enforces strict CSP which breaks the local dev server (Astro) frontend verification script, making headless browser verification difficult without disabling CSP or modifying the dev environment.
**Action:** Rely on unit tests (jest) for component verification, but be aware that dependencies might be missing.

## 2025-02-27 - Missing Test Dependencies
**Learning:** `getnexo-site` lists `jest` but is missing `jest-environment-jsdom` and babel presets, causing tests to fail out of the box.
**Action:** When running tests, be prepared to temporarily install these dependencies or ask for permission to add them permanently.

## 2025-02-27 - ChatInterface Layout
**Learning:** Hardcoded height (`h-[80vh]`) in `ChatInterface` causes layout overflow when embedded in a flex/grid container with calculated height (`calc(100vh - 280px)`).
**Action:** Use `h-full` to respect the parent container's constraints.

## 2025-02-27 - Dual Implementation of Store
**Learning:** The "Store" feature has two implementations: `CatalogManager.jsx` (used inside `OmniChatApp` tabs) and `loja.astro` (used for the sidebar route). Optimizing one does not affect the other.
**Action:** Verify which component is being targeted by checking the navigation context (Tab vs Sidebar).

## 2025-02-27 - Optimizing Drag and Drop
**Learning:** Monolithic components like `KanbanBoard` re-render entirely on drag events if not split. Extracting columns and cards into memoized components is essential for smooth dnd interactions in React.
**Action:** Always memoize drag handlers (`onDragStart`, `onDrop`) and list item components when implementing drag-and-drop.
